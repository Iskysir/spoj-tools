Transform the algebraic expression with brackets into RPN form (Reverse Polish Notation). Two-argument operators: +, -, *, /, ^ (priority from the lowest to the highest), brackets ( ). Operands: only letters: a,b,...,z. Assume that there is only one RPN form (no expressions like a*b*c).


<h3>Input
<PRE>
<i>t [the number of expressions <= <b>100']
<i>expression [length <= <b>400']
[other expressions]

<p align=left>
Text grouped in [ ] does not appear in the input file.


<h3>Output
<PRE>
The <em>expressions in RPN form, one per line.

<h3>Example
<PRE>
Input:
3
(a+(b*c))
((a+b)*(z+x))
((a+t)*((b+(a+c))^(c+d)))

Output:
abc*+
ab+zx+*
at+bac++cd+^*
